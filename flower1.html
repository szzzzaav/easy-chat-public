      <h2>Lily Flower</h2>
      <p>
        The lily is a genus of flowering plant that is important in culture and
        literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the
        temperate northern hemisphere, though their range extends into the
        northern subtropics. Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from
        2–6 ft (60–180 cm). They form naked or tunicless scaly underground bulbs
        which are their organs of perennation.
